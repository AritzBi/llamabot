## LlamaBot

An open-source Discord bot, created using LlamaIndex, that -
- Listens to your server conversations
- Continuously learns from them
- Answers your questions from the entire server.

Itâ€™s recommended to host this bot yourself for your server, but if you wanna try out first, you can invite the bot to your server through [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1203216926730616862&permissions=3072&scope=bot).

Tech stack used for this bot:
1. **LlamaIndex** as the RAG framework
2. **Google Gemini** Pro as the LLm and Embedding model
3. **Qdrant cloud** as the vectorstore
4. **discord.py** to setup the bot logic
5. Finally deploy it to **Replit**
